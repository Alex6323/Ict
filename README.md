# Iota Controlled Agent (Ict)

## About

The Iota Controlled Agent is a light-weight IOTA node for the Internet-of-Things relying on swarm logic.
It provides a basic gossip protocol which can be extended with various functionality through the IOTA Extension Interface (IXI).
This modular design enables the customization of the core node, allowing for all kinds of extensions to be plugged in.
